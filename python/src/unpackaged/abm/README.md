# Agent Based Model
#### This program models a set of two agents with randomized points in space moves them randomly and measure the distance between them
---
## Model Algorithm:
* Make a y variable.
* Make a x variable.
* Change y and x based on random numbers.
* Make a second set of y and xs, and make these change randomly as well.
* Work out the distance between the two sets of y and xs.
* Plot the agents in an evironment
